# WACCM_PulseTracer
Hi, you'll find all the setup files for implementing 10 idealized passive pulse tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). Specifically, the pulse tracer is released at the boundary layer over the entire Northern Hemisphere with concentration being set to 1 mol/mol only during the first day. The passive tracer has no specific sources/sinks or chemical reactions in the atmosphere interior. Its concentration is set to zero whenever the tracer is in contact with the surface again after its release. The transport of tracer is driven by both resolved and parameterized processes in the model. For summer months (July and August), we implement 10 tracers and release them on different days, that is, on 3, 10, 17, 24, and 31 July and 3, 10, 17, 24, and 31 August, respectively, to explicitly assess how the transport properties vary with synoptic variability of the monsoonal system.
